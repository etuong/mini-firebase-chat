## Mini Firebase Chat

This is a simplified stripped-down version of my [Firebase Chat](https://github.com/etuong/firebase-chat) app.

It's meant to be a super lightweight demo to introduce Developers to the awesomeness of backend-as-a-service.

To get started, you'll need to create a [Firebase](https://firebase.com/) project. Update the .env file with your API keys and IDs. After that, simply run `npm run start` and you're ready to chat!
